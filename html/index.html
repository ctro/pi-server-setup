<div id="about">
  <h2>About Juniper</h2>
  <img src="img/office1.jpg" alt="Three Peaks Massage Office"/>

  <p>I graduated from the Connecting Point School of Massage and Spa Therapies in Telluride, Colorado in 1996.</p>
  <p>Shortly thereafter, I moved to Jackson Hole and began practicing massage therapy at Southern Touch Massage and at spas and hotels including Amangani, Spring Creek Ranch, and The Alpine House. In 1999, I started Three Peaks Massage and moved into my current downtown office.</p>
  <p>I am nationally certified and a member of the American Massage Therapy Association. My style emphasizes sports stretching and deep tissue massage for the active recreationalist. I also offer hot stone therapy and reflexology treatments.</p>
  <p>Each session reflects thought, attention to detail and professionalism. I feel lucky enough to have established a long standing clientele of repeat costumers for 16 years and counting. I enjoy spending my free time hiking and skiing and savoring all Jackson Hole has to offer.</p>
